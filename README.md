# inferredDatModel

Define a custom dataset class XMLDataset to load shredded XML data and parse relevant information.
Define a simple CNN architecture using nn.Module and transformations for data augmentation and normalization.
Create DataLoader instances for training and validation sets.
Train the CNN model using the training data and evaluate the trained model on the validation set to measure its accuracy.

Replace "path/to/your/shredded/xml/data" with the actual path to your shredded XML data. 

Additionally, adjust the CNN architecture, transformation, and hyperparameters according to a specific problem and dataset.
